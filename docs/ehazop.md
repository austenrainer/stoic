# EHAZOP: Ethical HAZOP

[HAZOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_and_operability_study) can also be applied to what are termed "ethical hazards", these being all potential sources of ethical harm. A number of ethical hazards relevant to robots and robotic devices can be found in [BSI 8611](https://standardsdevelopment.bsigroup.com/projects/9021-05777), and include user robot addiction, lack of transparency and compromised user privacy. EHAZOP uses a systematic technique based on HAZOP (hazard analysis) to identify ethical hazards associated with the functionality or design of a robot.

EHAZOP, or Ethical HAZOP, uses a systematic technique based on HAZOP (hazard analysis) to identify ethical hazards associated with the functionality or design of a robot.

Ethical hazards are defined to be those events, properties or characteristics associated with the system which could potentially lead to ethical harm. As with HAZOP, we can use a collaborative, systematic process of guideword application to determine how ethical hazards can present in a given robot. For example:
- What ethical harm could result if a particular robot functionality is delivered EARLY? LATE?
- What ethical harm could result if a particular robot design is DIFFERENT to what is expected?
- What ethical harm could result if the robot takes MORE or LESS initiative in performing its stated functions?

EHAZOP is recommended to be applied only to public-facing robots, including assistive robots. Embodiment is not necessary; EHAZOP can also be applied to a disembodied AI.

EHAZOP guidewords are to be applied to different aspects, characteristics or functions of the robot, to determine whether any of the ethical hazards identified in [BSI 8611](https://standardsdevelopment.bsigroup.com/projects/9021-05777) may be present in this robot's specification or potential operation.

A summary of the guide words to be used in EHAZOP is included below:

| Guideword | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| More | some aspect, characteristic or function of the robot is increased or emphasised |
| Less  | some aspect, characteristic or function of the robot is decreased or de-emphasised |
| Not enough  | inadequate provision of some aspect, characteristic or function of the robot |
| Too much | there is too much provision or emphasis of some aspect, characteristic or function of the robot |
| Early  | some function or activity of the robot is performed earlier than expected |
| Late  | some function or activity of the robot is performed later than expected |
| Never  | some function or activity of the robot that is expected is never performed |
| As well as  | some function or activity of the robot has a side-effect unperceived by the user |
| Reverse  | some function or activity has the opposite effect from that expected by the user |
| Different  | some aspect, characteristic or function of the robot is increased or emphasized |


A summary of the aspects, characteristics or functions of the robot to be used in conjunction with the guidewords is included below:

| Component  | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Functionality  | the functions (each must be considered individually) performed by the robot |
| Physical design  | the physical design and appearance of the robot |
| Preliminary interactions  | the extent to which the robot interacts with the user outside of its prescribed minimal functionality |
| Movement  | the way in which the robot moves |
| Autonomy  | the extent to which the robot takes action or makes decisions without recourse to user input |
