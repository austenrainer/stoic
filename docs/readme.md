# STOICS: Stories and Computing

## Overview

The STOIC project is an ongoing collaboration between [Catherine Menon](https://researchprofiles.herts.ac.uk/en/persons/catherine-menon) and [Austen Rainer](https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/persons/austen-rainer) that is investigating the similarities, differences and mutual benefits of "story thinking" and "computational thinking". Indicative research questions are:

+ How do software engineers and writers think as they work on and with their respective artefacts, and what might software engineers and writers learn from each other? For example, we’ve taken a technique from safety software engineering and applied that technique in two recent workshops, one with professional writers and one with emerging writers, as they "workshop" each others' stories, in groups.
+ What are the mental models used by writers and software engineers, and how do those relate and contrast, and how do they affect, and are affected by, modes of thinking? For example, we’ve begun to explore ([here](https://ppig.org/files/2022-PPIG-33rd-rainer.pdf) how computational models “de-mean” stories, using a very simple and well-known six word story ("For sale. Baby shoes. Never worn.") as well as two "stories" from computer science. Looking ahead, we want to investigate whether and how stories might help software engineers develop software in a more responsible way, for example, using larger stories, such as memoirs.
+ How is language used by writers and software engineers, and how does that language affect, and is affected by, by models of thinking and respective mental models?
+ To what extent do existing concepts of _story_ in software engineering, such as the _user story_ and the _scenario_, "satisfy" the criteria for a story (in the fuller sense of the word "story")? Related to this, we are investigating the extent to which software engineering has grounded its concepts of story in the narrative disciplines.
