# Proof-of-concept pilot studies of CHAZOP

## Overview

We conducted two initial pilot study workshops to investigate participants’ perception of the CHAZOP process and its potential effect on their own writing. As these workshops were relatively small, they are intended to serve only as a proof of concept, with full validation of the CHAZOP process to follow. Both workshops utilised the full range of [CHAZOP guidewords](chazop.md), and a minimal set of fictive components (plot, setting, character, voice, theme). 

Qualitative and quantitative feedback was sought for both workshops, and both were approved by a relevant ethics committee (anonymised herein).

## Design and methodology

Both pilot study workshops were carried out at the Crescent Arts Centre in Belfast, using the same experimental process. Participants were recruited using social media advertising, personal outreach by Crescent Arts in accordance with GDPR regulations, and advertisement on the Crescent Arts homepage.

After obtaining consent, participants at both workshops were provided with an overview of the CHAZOP process and a high-level introduction to its aims. All participants had been encouraged to submit a piece of fiction prior to the workshop (either complete or incomplete). These were anonymised and distributed to all participants prior to the workshop so that they could prepare. The pieces submitted across both workshops included completed short story drafts, unfinished short story drafts and excerpts from completed novel drafts. 

Participants conducted a CHAZOP process on each of the pieces in turn, facilitated by the researchers at both workshops. Each piece was approximately 5000 words long, and the CHAZOP process lasted approximately one hour for each piece. 

## Post-study questionnaires

Following both of the workshops, participants were asked to complete an anonymous post-study questionnaire, requesting both qualitative and quantitative feedback. 

The quantitative feedback for both workshops included the following questions:

- Participants were asked to rank the fictive components in order of how useful they considered them within CHAZOP
- Participants were asked to rank the guide words in order of how useful they considered them within CHAZOP
- Participants were asked to give a numerical score of whether they considered CHAZOP useful for incomplete and for complete fiction (using a Likert-type scale where 0 = not at all, to 4 = very useful)
- Participants were asked to assess who they considered would benefit most from using CHAZOP (0 = novice writer, 3 = professional)

The second workshop also included two additional questions:

- Participants were asked how helpful they found the CHAZOP process to them personally as a writer (using a Likert-type scale where 0 = very unhelpful; 4 = very helpful)
- Participants were asked how helpful they found the CHAZOP process as a writing group participant workshopping somebody else’s writing (using a Likert-type scale where 0 = very unhelpful , 4 = very helpful)

The qualitative feedback asked the participants to provide their opinion on CHAZOP, and anything else they would like to be taken into account.
