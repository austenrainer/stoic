# Memoir in Software Engineering

## Aim

The aim of this programme of work is to investigate the contribution of memoir to software engineering. The main focus is on:
1. The use of memoir as  a source of information into the software engineering process itself. The most obvious contribution of memoir is into the requirements engineering process, e.g., suggesting stakeholders, however memoir may also make a contribution into other areas of software engineering, e.g., database design and software testing.
2. _How_ memoir uses language to _represent_ the world, in contrast to how software engineering uses language (natural or artificial) to represent the world. For example, a metaphor is a kind of abstraction, but a kind of abstraction very different to class-based inheritance.

but in addition, the programme also considers:

3. The use of memoir as a mechanism for sharing experience and insights into software engineering. The most well-known memoir in this category is probably Fred Brook's _The Mythical Man-Month_, in which Brooks share's his experience of developing IBM's OS/360 operating system, as well as reflecting on and proposing theoretical contributions, e.g., Brook's Law. An indicative reference here is Soyer and Hogarth's [The Myth of Experience](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/emre-soyer/the-myth-of-experience/9781541742055/).

## Why memoir?

A defining characteristic of memoir is that the author makes a _commitment_ to truth. Whilst truth is slippery - it's not easy to define and not easy to grasp - there is at least some grounding of the memoir in this actual world (as opposed to a fictional world). Memoir therefore presents, at least in principle, information more suited to software engineering. Consider, as a contrasting example, a requirements analyst interviewing a stakeholder. In such an interview, the stakeholder might offer information about their experience of the actual world. (In relation to [Rainer and Wohlin's credibility framework](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095058492200129X), the stakeholder is a more credible participant.) There are important differences, for example the interviewer has more direct and immediate influence on the information the stakeholder shares.

## _My Name is Why_, by Lemn Sissay

The main memoir used so far in this programme of work is Lemn Sissay's _My Name is Why_. Put very briefly, the memoir describes Sissay's experience as a Black person growing up in State-managed foster care in the UK during the late-1960s through early-1980s.

_My Name is Why_ memoir was selected because:

1. The memoir contains a large body of documentary evidence, collected independently of Sissay (and without his knowledge) during his childhood. Thus, in principle, the documentary evidence provides a different representation of the world - a different kind of representation of the world - compared to Sissay's personal experience of the world. (There is of course the issue that Sissay has _selected_ the documentary evidence to be included in the memoir.) Computational systems also represent the world. Consequently, the memoir supports the examination of different representations: the documentary evidence, Sissay's personal experience, possible computational representations. This connects to Contributions 2 and 3 above.
2. The memoir raises important questions about society, e.g., children living in foster care, the role of the State, prejudice (in particular, racism). This is important for challenging software engineers, and other computational thinkers, to think about to think both about a) the impact of computational systems on the world, and b) what can and cannot be represented in a computational system.
3. The memoir occurs at a time before computational systems were commonplace.

Many other memoirs were considered, including: Mohamedou Ould Slahi's _Guant√°namo Diary_, Jackie Kohnstamm's _The Memory Keeper_, Colin Grant's _Homecoming_, Polly Curtis' _Behind Closed Doors_, Suad Aldarra's _I Don't Want To Talk About Home_, and Clyde W. Ford's _Think Black_. All of these raise important questions about society (criterion #2 above) and some occur before the pervasive use of computational systems (criterion #3) however none provide the extent of documentary evidence (criterion #1) comparable to Sissay's memoir.

## Projects within the wider programme

Five projects have been successfully undertaken to date, or are being undertaken:
* An undergraduate final-year project that used the memoir to explore the design of a micro-services architecture to maintain information about foster children. This project assumed that the different institutions involved in the memoir (e.g., each school, each foster home) maintained their own information on children. The project looked at how these different institutions might create a way of sharing information between the institutions.
* An undergraduate final-year project that used the memoir to explore the design of a standalone software system in which children in care can raise concerns and requests about the behaviour of staff in a foster home.
* A taught postgraduate final-year project used the memoir to create an extensive set of user stories for two users, a foster child and a social worker, and then built a software system to satisfy those user stories.
* An MEng final-year research and development project that used the memoir to explore the limits of existing research on Personas, proposed a new method for constructing Personas and then developed a prototype software system to guide the interactive development of those Personas.
* In a taught final-year module with 150+ students, working in teams of 4-6 students, the students used the memoir as input into team-based software innovation. Each team identified a challenging 'problem' in the memoir, brainstormed ways to address that 'problem' and then prototyped a software solution for one of those ways.
