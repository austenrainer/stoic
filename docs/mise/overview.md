# Memoir in Software Engineering

## Aims and Contributions

The aim of this programme of work is to investigate the contribution of memoir to software engineering. Contributions include:
1. The use of memoir as a mechanism for sharing experience and insights into software engineering. The most well-known memoir in this category is probably Fred Brook's _The Mythical Man-Month_, in which Brooks share's his experience of developing IBM's OS/360 operating system, as well as reflecting on and proposing theoretical contributions, e.g., Brook's Law.
2. The use of memoir as  a source of information into the software engineering process itself. The most obvious contribution of memoir is into the requirements engineering process, e.g., suggesting stakeholders, however memoir may also make a contribution into other areas of software engineering, e.g., database design and software testing.
3. _How_ memoir uses language to _represent_ the world, in contrast to how software engineering uses language (natural or artificial) to represent the world. For example, a metaphor is a kind of abstraction, but a kind of abstraction very different to class-based inheritance.

## _My Name is Why_, by Lemn Sissay

The main memoir used so far in this project is Lemn Sissay's _My Name is Why_. Put very briefly, the memoir describes Sissay's experience as a Black person growing up in State-managed foster care in the UK during the late-1960s through early-1980s.

This _My Name is Why_ memoir was selected because:

1. It contains a large body of documentary evidence, collected independently of Sissay (and without his knowledge) during his childhood. Thus, in principle, the documentary evidence provides a different representation of the world - a different kind of representation of the world - compared to Sissay's personal experience of the world. (There is of course the issue that Sissay has _selected_ the documentary evidence to be included in the memoir.) Computational systems also represent the world. Consequently, the memoir supports the examination of different representations: the documentary evidence, Sissay's personal experience, possible computational representations. This connects to Contributions 2 and 3 above.
2. It raises important questions about society, e.g., children living in foster care, the role of the State, prejudice (in particular, racism). This is important for challenging software engineers, and other computational thinkers, to think about to think both about a) the impact of computational systems on the world, and b) what can and cannot be represented in a computational system.

Other memoirs were considered, including: Mohamedou Ould Slahi's _Guant√°namo Diary_, Jackie Kohnstamm's _The Memory Keeper_, Colin Grant's _Homecoming_, Polly Curtis' _Behind Closed Doors_, Suad Aldarra's _I Don't Want To Talk About Home_, and Clyde W. Ford's _Think Black_. All of these raise important questions about society (criterion #2 above) however none provide the extent of documentary evidence (criterion #1) comparable to Sissay's memoir.
