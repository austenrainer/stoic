# Ethical co-creativity with AI: A hands-on workshop at the International Conference on Computational Creativity 2024

This hands-on tutorial explores how software engineering techniques used to develop AI systems can be translated into creative practice to support and facilitate human - AI co-creativity. The tutorial introduces participants to techniques for identifying ethical concerns around AI, and explores how these concerns can inspire creative output across different domains. As part of this tutorial, participants will be offered the opportunity to develop a creative output such as a story or piece of art inspired by AI ethical concerns, using AI as a co-creative tool. Participants will then work collaboratively to analyse and improve these outputs using a modified version of existing AI development hazard analysis techniques.

## Description of the event’s purpose and scope

The purpose of the proposed workshop is to explore how we can use structured analysis techniques drawn from software safety engineering to support both the ethical creativity of individual humans and the ethical co-creativity of humans with AI. 

We'll begin by presenting participants with information about an example AI system and scenario, such as an assistive robot intended to help vulnerable users live independently in their homes. The workshop then explores how structured creative practice can facilitate the identification and discussion of ethical hazards and concerns with the proposed AI systems. 

We'll use two expansions of HAZOP in this workshop: the extant CHAZOP methodology and a new proposed methodology, EHAZOP, which is directed towards the identification of ethical hazards. Together, the workshop explores how creative practice can be used to examine the space of ethical hazards associated with the AI system provided.

## Description of the expected participants

Indicative number of participants are between six and eighteen participants.

We invite participants who:
•	Have a background in engineering, software, computation or safety assessment
•	Will create a supportive space for creativity;
•	Are willing to produce preliminary creative outputs in a time-constrained situation;
•	Are willing to share those creative outputs with others in the workshop;
•	Are interested in stories in their various forms, e.g., flash fiction, short stories;
•	Are open-minded to the unpredictability that arises with creativity.
