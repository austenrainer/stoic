# STOIC: STOrIes and Computing

## Overview

The STOIC project is an ongoing collaboration between [Catherine Menon](https://researchprofiles.herts.ac.uk/en/persons/catherine-menon) and [Austen Rainer](https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/persons/austen-rainer) that is investigating the similarities, differences and mutual benefits of "story thinking" and "computational thinking". Indicative questions being explored are:

+ How software engineers and writers think as they work on and with their respective artefacts, and what software engineers and writers might learn from each other. For example, we’ve (a colleague and I) taken a technique from safety software engineering and applied that technique in two recent workshops, one with professional writers and one with emerging writers, as they "workshop" each others' stories, in groups.
+ The mental models used by writers and software engineers, and how those relate and contrast, and how they affect and are affected by modes of thinking. For example, we’ve begun to explore how computational models “de-mean” stories, using a very simple and well-known six-word story ("For sale. Baby shoes. Never worn.") and two "stories" from computer science to explore these issues. Looking ahead, we want to investigate whether and how stories might help software engineers develop software in a more responsible way, for example, using larger stories, such as memoirs.
+ The language used by writers and software engineers, and how that affects, and is affected by, their thinking and their models.
+ Software engineering makes considerable use of story-like representations, in particular the user story and the scenario. We are also investigating the extent to which the user story and the scenario "satisfy" the criteria for a story; and, together with this, are investigating the extent to which software engineering has grounded its concepts of story in the narrative disciplines.
