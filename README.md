## Creative HAZOP

### Overview

Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP) is a structured, collaborative technique from safety engineering that uses a set of guidewords to ask "what could go wrong with the system? What would happen in each case?". We have taken HAZOP, modified it into Creative HAZOP (CHAZOP) and applied it to fiction editing. CHAZOP comprises a set of guidewords and a set of fictive components.

As with HAZOP, the guidewords are structured around information flows to each part of the system or, in our case, parts of the fictive artefact, e.g., a short story or a novel. Examples of guidewords are:
+ Early: what if some information gets to this part of the system / story too early?
+ Late: what if some information gets to this part of the system / story too late?
+ Reverse: what if information arrives at this part of the system / story in reverse order?
+ Partial: what if only some of the necessary information arrives at this part of the system / story?

In addition, we add a set of fictive components. The fictive components may be understood as parts of the "system". Examples of fictive components are:
+ Plot: structure and sequence of events
+ Setting: the physical, emotional, thematic environment
+ Character: the people undertaking action or experiencing the plot events
+ Voice: the syntax, vocabulary, metaphor, imagery and other literary devices
+ Theme: the development of underlying ideas, perspectives, resonances, moral standpoints or considerations
+ Structure: the perspective, tense, composition and organisation
+ Linguistic creativity: the language, word, style choice and sentence structure

Part of the activity of applying CHAZOP is to determine which fictive components are (most) important.

### Two modes of application

Creative HAZOP can be applied in two modes:
+ Critique: the reader (which might be the writer too) or readers attempts to identify what didn’t work for the reader
+ Brainstorming: the reviewers of the story undertake a "what if...?", e.g., what if some information was presented earlier, or later, or differently?

### Indicative types of fiction to which CHAZOP can be applied

Creative HAZOP has been successfully applied to:
+ Short stories
+ Chapters from novels
+ script

Furthermore, whilst Creative HAZOP might typically be applied to *drafts*, the technique can in principle be applied (retrospectively) to completed pieces of work, e.g., those that have been published.

### Fictive components

| Guide word | Meaning |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Not enough | Insufficient emphasis, clarity or focus on this fictive component |
| Too much | Too much emphasis, clarity or focus |
| Early | Information gathered by reader earlier than intended |
| Late | Information gathered by reader later than intended |
| Never| Information never gathered by reader! |
| As well as | Side effect, or additional information conveyed to reader |
| Reverse | Opposite of the writer’s intent |
| More | Effect of increasing focus on, or adding to, this component |
| Less | Effect of decreasing focus on, or reducing, this component |
| Before |Effect of a specified fictive component being encountered by the reader prior to another |
| After | Effect of a specified fictive component being encountered by the reader after another |
| Same | Information conveyed to the reader about this component remains the same throughout |
| Different| Information conveyed to the reader about this component changes |
